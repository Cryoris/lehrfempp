## Tests for (local) refinement in LehrFEM++

Invoke the bash script `run_rrt.sh` from the LehrFEM++ root directory. It will 
- run the test code that also performs a few consistency checks using the Google testing framework
- call MATLAB to plot the meshes generated by the test code
- save the meshes as PDFs.
